  VClass is an android application that provides the features of a classroom from 
  the comfort of peopleâ€™s homes. Using virtual reality technology, a more immersive and
  interactive experience can be had relative to the typical online video conferencing or 
  classroom software.
</dl>

Start
==========
Open the project VClass in Android Studio and install to device

<dl>
  The application uses firebasee as an online database to handle thus to use run the application
  you will first need to set the firebase URL in the following classes to one that u can run.
  <dd></dd>
   <dd> 
     Classes : LiveStudentClassActivity, DBHelper, BoardListActivity
   </dd>
   <dt>
      replace        FIREBASE_URL = "_insert url here_"
   </dt><dd></dd>
  
  Note: For multiple devices to use, the local SQL databse of the initial device will need to be shared,
        but it will run  on a single device.
     
   Currently to store credentials and other information, we are using a local SQL database.
   This is being loaded with .csv files currenly that ar using a specific format. Thus loading functions
   for timetable will not work without them present (currently in assets folder as we are using the emulator)
   but the values can be manually inserted for running as well. 
   the local database is at "data/com.example.vclasslogin/databases/VClass_Users.db" in phone
   currently some values for testing are initialisd at line 47-50 in LoginActivity.java, that stets up some accounts
   such as admin, student, and teacher.
   
   Default Admin's account is:
   <dt>
      username = "admin"
   </dt><dt>
      password = "pass"
    </dt>
    <dd></dd>
  This account can be used to set some initial accounts for students and teachers for testing
  
  Some student accounts are 
  <dt>
      username = "student1", "student2", "student3", "student4"
   </dt><dt>
      password = "1234" for all
    </dt>
    <dd></dd>
  some teacher accounts are 
  <dt>
      username = "teacher1", "teacher2", "teacher3", "teacher4"
   </dt><dt>
      password = "1234" for all
    </dt>
     
</dl>

Current Implementation
==========
We are currently using 2 databases, a local SQL database, that
will be moved to the firebase later on, and firebase to manage the online functions
and information for the whiteboard and chat-room. The SQL database is used to store
data such as the credentials, timetable slots, courses information, and other information
related components.

For the whiteboard, we are using a firebase-based implementation, where each
course has a unique whiteboard link generated. the links and their corresponding
information, such as lines, are stored on firebase and constantly synced with other
endpoints that have the same whiteboard opened. For example, the whiteboard for the
course Programming Fundamentals (PF) is opened by teacher1 and student1, the teacher
writes something on the board, the inputs are quickly uploaded to the database and all
other instances of the current whiteboard, in this case, student1, will also have their
views updated simultaneously.

For the chat-room, we are again using a firebase-based implementation where
the messages are uploaded and retrieved by the firebase handler. to set it up for a group
chat, messages sent by different people have the course name as a receiver, where the
course name refers to the group chat those messages belong to.



=====================================================================================
Unity Component
The unity components for teacher and students are built as separate unity projects (later made 
into different scenes). Photon is used for the networking between different users.

Teacher side
This is a 3d unity project used to show a 2d user interface. The teacher side has 3 key 
functionalities; shared whiteboard(editable by teacher), shared document(changed and navigated 
by teacher) and voice functionalities.

Student side
This is a full 3d environment that can be viewed in either a 3d video mode or a VR mode by
using google cardboard. The students can use this to view the shared whiteboard, shared document
and voice chat with the rest of the class and teacher when so desired.

Photon networking
We photon for unity for the networking and voice aspect of our project. Photon voice is used for the 
voice call functionality for each room and photon pun is used to trigger events so as all the students 
who are in a session will be shown the same changes to their respective sides.
